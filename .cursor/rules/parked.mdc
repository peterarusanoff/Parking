## Route: parked

- Base path: `/api/parked`
- Purpose: Log vehicle entries/exits and maintain hourly occupancy.
- Key behaviors:
  - `POST /api/parked` – creates a parked entry (enter event):
    - Validates garage (and user/pass if provided).
    - Inserts event; increments `garageDailyOccupancy.hourlyOccupancy[enteredHour]`.
  - `PUT /api/parked/:id` – updates parked entry (exit event):
    - If `exitedAt` transitions from null → timestamp, decrements `hourlyOccupancy[exitHour]`.
  - GET endpoints for lists and single entries (optional filters: `garageId`, `active`).
- Data integrity:
  - Occupancy creation upserts by day (midnight) if missing.
  - Clamps occupancy to >= 0.
- Guidance:
  - Consider adding capacity cap enforcement if needed.
  - Associate `userId` where possible for analytics.
