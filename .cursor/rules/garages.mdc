## Route: garages

- Base path: `/api/garages`
- Purpose: Manage garages, capacity, and analytics entrypoints.
- Key behaviors:
  - CRUD for garages; `capacity` included in responses.
  - Standardize path param to `:id` to avoid route conflicts.
- Endpoints (typical):
  - `GET /api/garages` – list garages.
  - `POST /api/garages` – create garage.
  - `GET /api/garages/:id` – get garage (with capacity).
  - `PUT /api/garages/:id` – update garage details/capacity.
  - `DELETE /api/garages/:id` – delete garage.
- Auth:
  - Admin-only for mutations in production.
- Notes:
  - Analytics and reporting endpoints may live here or in `admin`.
  - Ensure integrity with occupancy tracking (capacity awareness).
