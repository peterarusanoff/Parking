⚙️ Vend Technical Assessment
"Billing, Subscriptions & Multi-Tenant Reporting Architecture"

🧬 Overview
Vend provides monthly parking passes for drivers at various garages.

Your task is to design and prototype a billing and reporting foundation for this system — focusing on:

Data modeling
Billing logic and lifecycle
Reporting design for both Vend leadership and garage admins
(Bonus) Optional visual reporting in React using shadcn/ui

You'll evolve simple models into a billing-ready system, implement mock billing logic in TypeScript, and design a reporting architecture that supports multi-tenant data visibility.

Estimated time: 3–5 hours

Technology Stack - Please use the following technology stack. You may choose to use something else if you provide a decent explanation:

Bun
Typescript
React
Vite
Shadcn UI
Any backend database and server solution of your choice



🛡️ Part 1: Base Models
You start with three core entities:

// User
{
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
}

// Garage
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
}

// Pass
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
}


🤠 Part 2: Extend for Billing
Vend wants users to purchase monthly passes for specific garages.
Your Task
Update or add models to support recurring billing. Consider:

How a pass becomes a priced product.
How a user subscribes to a pass.
What attributes are needed to track pricing, payment status, renewals, and cancellations.
How garage admins can view data only for their own garages.

Show your final set of models (TypeScript interfaces or an ER diagram).

Describe your billing lifecycle — what happens when a user purchases, renews, or cancels a pass.

🔹 You do not need to integrate with Stripe or any live service. You can mock data and API calls to simulate billing behavior.

🤓 Focus: schema design, lifecycle understanding, scalability.


💻 Part 3: Implementation (TypeScript)
Implement minimal TypeScript code that demonstrates:

A function to create a pass with a monthly price.

createGaragePass(passId: string, monthlyPrice: number)

A function to simulate subscribing a user to a pass.

subscribeUserToPass(userId: string, passId: string)

A function to generate a simple revenue report that aggregates subscription data by garage.

Example (mocked) output:

[
  {
    "garage": "Harwood No. 10",
    "activeSubscriptions": 12,
    "monthlyRevenue": 1800
  },
  {
    "garage": "Skyline Garage",
    "activeSubscriptions": 7,
    "monthlyRevenue": 1050
  }
]

🔹 You can use hardcoded or generated mock data for users, passes, and subscriptions. No database or API integration is required — focus on clean, well-typed logic.


🗾 Part 4: Data Warehouse & Reporting Design
Vend's leadership and garage admins both need reporting, but with different scopes of visibility.
Your Task
Propose a data warehouse schema (e.g., Snowflake-style) that supports both global and per-garage reporting.

Include the fact and dimension tables you'd create.
Explain how your schema supports access control and freshness.

Outline a high-level data flow from source data → warehouse → dashboard.

Design and describe the reports or dashboards you believe would be most valuable for these two types of users.

You decide what metrics or KPIs to track and visualize.
Consider financial, operational, and usage-based insights.

🤓 Focus: data modeling, analytics intuition, and multi-tenant reporting design.


🎨 Bonus (Optional Front-End Visualization)
If you have time, build a simple React + shadcn/ui component that visualizes one or more of your reports.

You may use Recharts, Chart.js, or similar.
Keep styling clean and focused on readability.
This is entirely optional and will be treated as a bonus.

🤓 Focus: full-stack perspective and clear data presentation.


📦 Deliverables
models.ts — updated and/or new data models
billing.ts — mock billing logic and TypeScript examples
reporting.md — warehouse schema + your chosen reports/dashboards
(Optional) dashboard.tsx — simple chart or widget component
README.md — setup, design reasoning, and sample output


⏱️ Expected Duration
3–5 hours total.

Focus on clarity, reasoning, and design choices — not completeness or production-level detail. Mocked logic and example data are completely acceptable.
